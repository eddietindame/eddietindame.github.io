# Eddie Tindame's Portfolio

A work in progress project.

## Includes

  * HTML5, CSS3
  * SASS, Jade

Notes
```
	* Markup is seriously unsemantic - I plan to remove a bunch of the foundation classes and use Sass mixins to extend existing classes into the displayed elements. Foundation 6 has extra support for this - I'm hoping to upgrade soon.
	* Javascript not working on mobile devices. I have only tested this on my iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet.
	* ^^ Normalize confirms JS but scripts don't complete??
