# Eddie Tindame's Portfolio

A work in progress project.

## Includes

  * HTML5, CSS3
  * SASS, Jade

Plans
```
* Markup is seriously unsemantic - I plan to remove a bunch of the foundation classes and use Sass mixins to extend existing classes into the displayed elements. Foundation 6 has extra support for this - I'm hoping to upgrade soon.
* Combine svg icons into one sprite-sheet.
* Minify JS / CSS.
* Clean up comments etc.
```

Notes
```
* Javascript not working on mobile devices. I have only tested this on my iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet.
* ^^ Normalize confirms JS but scripts don't complete??
```
