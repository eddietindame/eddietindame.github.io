# Eddie Tindame's Portfolio

A work in progress project.

  * HTML5, CSS3
  * Javascript, jQuery
  * SASS and Jade are awesome :-)

# Plans
~~* Markup is seriously unsemantic - I plan to remove a bunch of the foundation classes and use Sass to extend existing classes into the displayed elements. Foundation 6 has extra support for this - I'm hoping to upgrade soon.~~
* Improve cross browser compatibility (svg not responsive in FireFox??)
*  ^ & W3C validity
* Combine icons into sprite-sheet.
* Concatenate all my used JS files / unlink markup from bower-components.
* Clean up comments etc.

Notes (important)
```
* Javascript not working properly on mobile devices older than iPhone 6.
* ^^ Normalize confirms JS but scripts don't complete??
* ^^ My Js and CSS have necessary compatibility fixes applied (babel, auto-prefix).
```
