# Eddie Tindame's Portfolio
A work in progress project.
* HTML5, CSS3
* Javascript, jQuery, React
* SASS and Pug are awesome :-)
* Responsive
* Autoprefix is life

# Installation
You'll need Node and Ruby installed.
Dependencies are handled via NPM, compile with Gulp.
Get your local copy up and running with:
```
npm i -g gulp-cli
npm i
gulp
```

# Plans
* Remove jQuery dependency and move to vanilla JS where possible (in-progress)
