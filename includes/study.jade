        p I am currently studying BSc Multimedia Technology & Design at the University of Kent, Canterbury. As I am focusing on my studies, I cannot offer any freelance work, but I am looking for work placements as a Junior Web Developer.
        p I love the Web! I want nothing more than to expand my knowledge of web technologies and hone my skills into that of a real professional. Help me make that happen by offering me experience!
        p Please visit my GitHub page where you will find the repository for this website. The README file covers relevant background info and the upcoming changes to be made.
