# grunt-fast-watch

> similar to [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch), but faster. 

## Why Another Watch?

[grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) somtime didn't capture fs event (in windows). And, it too slow for my purpose.

I using `fast-watch` to restart server for reloading source code in development.

I am impatience, so made this.



## Features

* fast, fast, fast!
* surely capture fs event in windows.
* watch `dir`, not `file`
* support ignore setting(git ignore style, visit [ignore][ig]) 
* call different task by file path matching   
* didn't unwatch when call `tasks`
* after running `tasks`, restart `fastWatch` task ( without redundant watch )

## Getting Started

If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile][Getting Started] as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev grunt-fast-watch
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-fast-watch');
```

*Tip: the [load-grunt-tasks](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) module makes it easier to load multiple grunt tasks.*

## Examples
 

```coffee
 
trim = (str)->
  str.replace /(^\s*)|(\s*$)/gm, ""
fromLines = (patterns)->
  return trim(patterns).split('\n').map (pattern)->
    trim(pattern)


ignoreDir = fromLines """ 
.git
.gitignore
tmp        
node_modules

"""
serverCares = fromLines """
*.coffee       
*.json
""" 

clientCares = fromLines """ 
*.coffee   
!Gruntfile.coffee
package.json 
"""  # every coffee file, but Gruntfile.coffe + package.json
 
module.exports = (grunt)->   
 
  grunt.initConfig 
    fastWatch:
      cwd:     
        dir : '.' 
        ignoreSubDir : ignoreDir 
        trigger:
          server:  
            care : serverCares
            tasks: ["print:Server"]
          client: 
            care : clientCares  
            tasks: ['print:Client']

  grunt.loadTasks 'tasks' 

  grunt.registerTask 'print', (arg)-> console.log 'PRINT ',arg
  grunt.registerTask 'default', 'fastWatch:cwd'

   
```

Watch all event under `dir` ( `.` = current workign directory ) exclude sub-direcoty matched by `.ignoreSubDir`

When file system event wached, it test `trigger.*.care`

If passed, run tasks.


## Configuration


`dir` & `ignoreSubDir` designate dirs which are watched.

`trigger` contains `tasks` list which are called by `care`

See [ignore][ig] for `ignoreSubDir` and `care`

**one more thing, matching of `care` is reverse result of [ignore][ig]**

Put simply, [ignore][ig] module filter out changed file path, then watcher cares. And vice versa.

It may be seem weird, but [ignore]][ig] is just filepath filter.

Anyway, write pattern naturally then fast-watch understands.
