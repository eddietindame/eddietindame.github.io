# Eddie Tindame

## Summary

I‚Äôm a software engineer with 8+ years of experience building and maintaining applications across the full stack at both large tech companies and fast-paced digital agencies. I specialize in writing type-safe, well-tested, and maintainable code, with a strong focus on user experience. I have led migrations to modern technologies, established best practices for testing and documentation, and helped streamline development processes to reduce tech debt and improve long-term scalability.

I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with designers, product managers, and other engineers to turn ideas into polished, high-quality features. I‚Äôm experienced in real-time applications, functional user interfaces, and crafting engaging front-end experiences, always balancing technical excellence with great UI/UX.

I‚Äôm always looking for ways to progress, whether by championing new tools, refining workflows, or sharing knowledge. I‚Äôm excited to take on a senior engineering role where I can combine my technical expertise and design sensibility to make a lasting impact.
