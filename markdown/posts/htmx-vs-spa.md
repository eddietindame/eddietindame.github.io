There's a lot of hype surrounding HTMX these days. A lot of developers are embracing the world of Hypermedia and Multiple Page Applications (MPAs) as a response to the ever-more-complex world of frontend web frameworks. Are all trends cyclical?

My gut reaction was that these are all backend developers who want to be able to make functional tools without having to learn (much) Javascript, however, I had to check out HTMX for myself to see how it stacks up. I've been learning Go lately, which made for the perfect opportunity to write a server rendered MPA.

I'm going to try to see if this approach feels faster and less complex for a simple app or whether or not I will be itching to switch back to React the whole way through!
